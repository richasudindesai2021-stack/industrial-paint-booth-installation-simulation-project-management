# Industrial Paint Booth Installation Project (PRISM)

## Overview
Managed the **PRISM – Paint Room Installation for Safety & Manufacturing** project as part of PMI-LA x UCLA MASDS Case Challenge 2025.  
This project simulated a real-world industrial installation at TractorCo’s El Segundo facility to eliminate production bottlenecks, balancing **scope, cost, risk, and schedule trade-offs**.

## Key Highlights
- **Led a 5-member cross-functional team** to deliver the project on time and within a $430K budget.  
- Conducted **risk and cost uncertainty analysis** using Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 trials).  
- Built complete project documentation — Charter, WBS, Gantt Chart, Risk Register, and Stakeholder Matrix.  
- **Won Best Data Visualization Award** for analytical clarity and execution.  
- Delivered successful project completion with CPI = 0.98 and SPI = 0.95.

## 🧮 Analytical Insights
- **Monte Carlo Simulation (10,000 trials):** Estimated total project risk cost between **$4,905 (P50)** and **$11,041 (P90)**.  
- **Change Management:** Fire Marshal DCDA requirement added +$10K and +19 days schedule variance.  
- **Earned Value Metrics:**  
  - CPI = 0.98 → Slightly over budget  
  - SPI = 0.95 → Minor delay, within control  
- **Risk Matrix Highlights:** Installation (5×3=15) and Facility Prep (2×5=10) were highest-risk areas.
